# JobShopAlgorithms

This is my work for an Engineering Thesis at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. The thesis is titled "Algorytmy dla problemu szeregowania zada≈Ñ" (eng. "Algorithms for the scheduling problem"). The thesis is written in Polish.
## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of the following algorithms for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP):
 - Algorithm for two machines problem
 - Algorithm for two jobs problem
 - Branch and Bound algorithm for general problem
 - Shift bottleneck heuristic for general problem

## Usage

The algorithms are implemented in Julia 1.9.0.
